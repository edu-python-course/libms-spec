                   Library Management System - Specification
###############################################################################

The Library Management System is a Django-based web application that offers a
digital platform for managing and interacting with a library's collection. It
streamlines the processes of book lending, returns, and inventory management,
while ensuring easy access for users and librarians alike. Through this system,
users can search for available books, place borrowing requests, and manage
their borrowed items. Librarians, on the other hand, oversee the addition,
update, and removal of book records, and can approve or decline borrowing
requests. The system also supports diverse user roles, from regular members to
staff and administrators, each with distinct capabilities.

A well-structured user interface ensures that all functionalities are easily
accessible, making the library management process seamless and efficient. This
project aims to merge traditional library functions with modern technological
innovations, promoting efficiency and an enhanced user experience.
